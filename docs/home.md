# Welcome to the User Manuals

This site consolidates all user manuals into **one place** to avoid multiple file sends and confusion.

## How to Use This Site

- **Open the menu**: Click the **☰ Menu** button at the bottom-left.  
- **Pick a manual**: In the **Manuals** list, select the document you want to read. It opens in the main area.
- **Follow sections with TOC**: The **Table of Contents** on the **right** (desktop) lists the sections of the current manual. Click any entry to **jump** to that section.
- **On mobile**: The TOC is hidden to save space; use the **Menu** for navigation. Headings inside the manual are still anchorable.
- **Dark/Light theme**: Use the **Toggle Dark/Light** switch at the bottom of the menu.

## Helpful Tips

- **Cross-links between manuals** work—if a page links to another `.md`, it opens in place.
- **Images** scale to your screen.
- **Back to Home**: Click the **company logo** in the header (top-left) to jump back to this Home page.

> If you need help or spot a broken link, notify the documentation team.
